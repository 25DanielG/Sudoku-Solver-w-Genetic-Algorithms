# Sudoku-Solver-w-Genetic-Algorithms
This project is an interesting experiment of solving sudoku with a genetic algorithm. A genetic algorithm is roughly simulating life on Earth with different generations and populations. While the runtime may be slow and a solution not guarranteed, this is an interesting and fun project.
